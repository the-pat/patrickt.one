Hello, I'm Patrick and welcome to my personal website. I am a software developer with a strong interest in software architecture and functional programming (like F# and Elixir). My goal is to become an expert in these areas, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skillset and deliver high-quality software solutions.

I also enjoy reading, hiking, playing board games, and collecting hobbies. I believe that having diverse interests helps me to think creatively and approach problems from different perspectives.

I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you through this website, and I hope that you find it informative and helpful. I always keep in mind the phrase "Ars longa, vita brevis" which means "Art is long, life is short" and it reminds me that there is always something new to learn. If you have any questions or just want to connect, feel free to send me an email. Thanks for visiting!
